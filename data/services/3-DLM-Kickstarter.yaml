<p>You know what you want to achieve, and perhaps you’ve already bought or built some software to help manage the process, but you need some help to get it all working. After all, tools are fantastic, but you need to know how to set them all up and to use them wisely.</p>

<p>DLM Consultants can help. Our DLM Kick-starter package is designed to help you make real progress within a focused, fixed time period. We can’t say exactly what we’ll help you with, because it depends on what you need and how quickly your organisation can move, but we’ll do what we can to help you make some rapid progress.</p>

<p>Principal consultant, Alex Yates, has worked both on-site and remotely with large and small organisations across many geographies and industry sectors. He’s seen the good, the bad and the ugly and he has helped many organisations to take their next step with SQL Server or Oracle DLM.</p>

<p>Our philosophy is not to build your pipeline for you. We will help you to build it for yourself. We’ll pair with you but we won’t touch the keyboard. It is important that your people are able to implement and manage your own pipeline as quickly as possible. If you are dependent on our services for a long period of time, we have not done our job properly.</p>
